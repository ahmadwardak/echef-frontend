# eChef Frontend
 
##  Prerequisites

Both for the front end and the back end, check:

* nodejs [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) - nodejs includes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (node package manager)


## Getting Started

You need git to clone our frontend and [backend](https://github.com/ahmadwardak/echef-backend.git) repository.

Do not forget to install and run the backend including MongoDB first.

For the frontend, clone our repository here.
```
git clone https://github.com/ahmadwardak/echef-frontend.git
cd echef-frontend/
```

### Install Dependencies

You can use `./install-build-run-start.sh` to install, build, run, and start the application, or follow the next steps to do that step by step:


We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com).

```
npm install
```

### Create a Bundle for the Application

This project use [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) version 1 for creating a bundle of the application and its dependencies

We have pre-configured `npm` to automatically run `webpack` so we can simply do:

```
npm run build
```

Behind the scenes this will call `webpack --config webpack.config.js `.  After, you should find that you have one new folder in your project.

* `dist` - contains all the files of your application and their dependencies.

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`.
